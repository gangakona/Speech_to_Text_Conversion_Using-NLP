## Introduction
Speech to Text conversion is a fundamental task in NLP that involves converting spoken language into written text. This project utilizes machine learning models and NLP techniques to perform accurate transcription of audio files. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for converting audio recordings, such as interviews, lectures, or meetings, into textual transcripts.
## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the growing demand for accurate and efficient speech recognition systems. With the increasing prevalence of voice-controlled devices and applications, there is a need for robust STT systems that can accurately transcribe audio recordings in real-time. By leveraging NLP techniques, we aim to develop a sophisticated solution that not only converts speech to text but also incorporates language understanding and context analysis for enhanced accuracy and usability.
